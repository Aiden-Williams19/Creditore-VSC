        <h2>What is Debt Mediation?</h2>
        <p>
          Debt Mediation (also known as Debt Management or Dispute Resolution) is a solution for South Africans who are struggling to make debt repayments but are not yet classified as over-indebted.
        </p>
        <p>
          We negotiate with your creditors to initiate a repayment plan. You pay one monthly instalment to the Payment Facilitation Agency (PFA), which then distributes the funds to your creditors.
        </p>
