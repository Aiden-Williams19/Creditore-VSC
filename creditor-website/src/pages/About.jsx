            <h2>FAQs</h2>
            <h4>Will my credit score improve after Debt Review?</h4>
            <p>Yes. After completion you receive a clearance certificate and your credit record is updated to show you are debt-free.</p>
            <h4>Can I still use credit during Debt Review?</h4>
            <p>No. You may not take on new credit while under review — this prevents deeper indebtedness.</p>
            <h4>What happens if I skip a payment?</h4>
            <p>Missing payments can lead to the review being terminated. Contact us immediately if you have difficulty paying so we can help.</p>
            <h4>Can I exit Debt Review early?</h4>
            <p>Yes, if your debts are fully settled or you no longer meet the over-indebted criteria.</p>
            <h4>How long does the process take?</h4>
            <p>Timing depends on total debt and repayment capacity, but most clients complete the process within 3–5 years.</p>
