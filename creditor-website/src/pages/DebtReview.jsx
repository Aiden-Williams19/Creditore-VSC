            <h2>What is Debt Review?</h2>
            <p>
              Debt Review is a formal process designed to help customers who are struggling to meet their debt obligations. A debt counsellor will assess
              your finances and negotiate with creditors on your behalf to reduce monthly payments to a manageable amount. This process provides breathing
              room while you repay your debts under a structured plan.
            </p>

            <h3>Key considerations</h3>
            <ul className="feature-list">
              <li>You may be restricted from applying for new credit while under review.</li>
              <li>Your status will be recorded with credit bureaus until the review is complete.</li>
              <li>Debt counselling fees apply, but we provide transparent pricing and support.</li>
              <li>Payments must continue as agreed under the new plan to remain protected.</li>
            </ul>
