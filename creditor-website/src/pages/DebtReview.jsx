        <h2>What is Debt Review?</h2>
        <p>
          Debt Review is a process that helps customers who are struggling to meet their debt obligations. A debt counsellor approaches your creditors and negotiates payment arrangements on your behalf, reducing your payments to a manageable monthly amount.
        </p>
        <p>Once you are under debt review, note that:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>You will not be able to apply for credit.</li>
          <li>You will be listed on the credit bureau while under review.</li>
          <li>You will be liable for paying debt counselling fees.</li>
          <li>You will still need to pay your instalments while under review.</li>
          <li>You will get assistance from a debt counsellor throughout the process.</li>
        </ul>
